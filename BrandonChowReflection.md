# Comp Eng Arduino Project Reflection
## **Challenges**
In this past project, the challenges that I had met occured during the CADing process to create a 3D mold for my arduino devices. 
However, I found it very difficult to find the correct measurements for some of these parts which resulted in 2 holes that required drilling. 
## **Future Learning Experiences**
A topic that I would want to learn more about is how to use the LCD screens. 
I feel like this would be interesting to learn about since there are so many different applications of the screen which can be used in future projects.
